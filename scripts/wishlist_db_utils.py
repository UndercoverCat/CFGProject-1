    This function takes the name of the MySQL database and forms a connection between Python and the database. The
    attempt to form the connection is executed through the use of a try-except block so that appropriate errors are able
    to be raised when a connection isn't able to be formed.
    It uses the mysql.connector package to generate the connection.
    Parameters
    -----------
    db_name: str
        Identifier to search the MySQL database to find the name of the database to form the connection. db_name is the
        name of the database.

    --------
    cnx: mysql.connector.connection.MySQLConnection

    ------
    Exception
        The exception clause in the try-except block will raise an Error according to the Error module found in the
        mysql.connector package, whereby the different possible types of error raised are printed as appropriate.

    This function is given input data as a list of variables. This list of variables was originally sent as a
    dictionary which was deconstructed in the app.py file. These variables are then added appropriately to the

    This function makes use of the INSERT IGNORE command rather than the INSERT command. If a record doesn't duplicate
    an existing record, then MySQL inserts it as usual. If the record is a duplicate, then the IGNORE keyword tells
    MySQL to discard it silently without generating an error.
